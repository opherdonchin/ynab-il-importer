# Agent Instructions

- Read `documents/project_context.md` and `documents/plan.md` first. 
- Use `project_context.md` to get a general orientation on project goals and priorities.
- Use `plan.md` to understand where we are step by step and what has been accomplished. 
- Keep `plan.md` updated by copying the current version into the `documents/archive` directory with a date and time stamp appended to the filename and then modifying the plan so that it reflects the current state, with a focus on where things stand now and where we need to go and less interest in maintaining historical notes. 
- Update `plan.md` every time we commit.

All work should follow that plan unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
